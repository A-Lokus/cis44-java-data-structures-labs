I am choosing option B, the Smart Scheduler, with the presented issue and goal of managing an incoming stream of requests where certain tasks are more urgent than others regardless of when they were inputted. To remedy this situation, I will choose to implement a Min-Heap Priority Queue data structure where the incoming requests are inserted as entries with key values, most likely integers, identifying their priority with the value of each entry being the task requested. The lower the value of the key, the higher priority (e.g. 0 is the highest priority, 1 is second most important, etc.). Each insertion of a new request entry into the heap will check to see if an upheap is required to make sure the minimum key, or the highest priority task, is at the top of the heap. After or when executing the highest priority task, I will remove the task from the heap of pending tasks and then follow the downheap procedure to ensure the heap maintains the properties of a Min-Heap. Although it would be possible to implement a Max-Heap for the same situation, I will be choosing to utilize a Min-Heap based on my familiarity with the implementation as well as the hierarchical nature of a Min-Heap where high-priority inserted tasks would be assigned lesser numbers signifying their urgency. Furthermore, this implementation of a Heap is imperative to ensure that higher priority tasks are handled before lower priority tasks inserted earlier, as each time a new task is inserted, the highest priority task is placed first, regardless of whether or not there were lower-order tasks inserted prior.
